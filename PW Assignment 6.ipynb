    ">>>Encapsulation: Imagine you have a box that holds several items. Encapsulation is like putting those items inside the box and closing it. In OOP, encapsulation is about bundling related data (attributes) and functions (methods) into objects, and hiding the inner workings of those objects from the outside world. It allows you to control access to the internal state of an object, ensuring that it is accessed and modified only through designated methods. Encapsulation helps keep the code organized, improves security, and makes it easier to maintain and modify.\n",
    "\n",
    ">>>Inheritance: Think of inheritance as passing down traits or characteristics from one generation to the next. In OOP, inheritance allows you to define a new class based on an existing class, inheriting its attributes and behaviors. The new class is called a \"subclass\" or \"child class,\" and the existing class is called the \"superclass\" or \"parent class.\" This mechanism promotes code reusability and allows you to create specialized classes that inherit common characteristics from a more general class. It helps to organize and structure code, reducing duplication and making it easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    ">>>Polymorphism: Polymorphism is like having multiple forms or shapes. In OOP, polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they belong to a common class, enabling them to be used interchangeably. This means that you can have different objects that share a common interface, but each object can behave differently when the same method is called. Polymorphism helps create flexible and adaptable code, as it allows you to write code that can work with objects of different types, without needing to know their specific implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    ">>>Abstraction: Abstraction is about simplifying complex things by focusing on the essential aspects and hiding unnecessary details. In OOP, abstraction allows you to create abstract classes or interfaces that define the common behavior and characteristics of a group of related objects, without providing the specific implementation. This way, you can create a blueprint or contract for how objects should behave, and leave the implementation details to the concrete classes that inherit from the abstract class or implement the interface. Abstraction helps to manage complexity, promotes code modularity, and provides a higher level of understanding and interaction with objects."
